Certainly! Here's the updated version of the documentation with "ETH" replaced by "OKT":

## Savings Contract Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the Savings Contract, a Solidity smart contract that allows users to save OKT and earn Ine tokens with compound interest. It also includes instructions on how to integrate the contract with a React frontend.

### Contract Details

The Savings Contract is a smart contract built on the OKExChain blockchain. It offers the following features:

- Users can deposit OKT into the contract and earn Ine tokens based on the elapsed time and the deposit amount.
- The contract calculates compound interest at a rate of one Ine token per OKT per week.
- Users can withdraw their OKT and Ine token balances separately.
- The contract implements a lock time of 1 week, during which the deposited funds cannot be withdrawn.

### Integration with React Frontend

To integrate the Savings Contract with a React frontend, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   - web3.js: `npm install web3`

2. Import the SavingsContract JSON file:
   - Download the `SavingsContract.json` file from this repository and save it in the relevant directory of your React project.

3. Create a new React component, e.g., `SavingsContract.js`.

4. Copy the provided React code into the `SavingsContract.js` file.

5. Replace `'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'` in the code with the actual address of your deployed Savings Contract.

6. Update the contract ABI in the `import SavingsContract from './contracts/SavingsContract.json'` line if you have modified the contract.

7. Customize the React component as needed, e.g., styling, additional UI elements, etc.

8. Run your React application and verify that the frontend is successfully connected to the Savings Contract. You should be able to see the user's OKT and Ine token balances and perform deposit and withdrawal actions.

### Further Customization

The provided code is a basic implementation and can be further customized to suit your specific requirements. Here are some possible enhancements:

- Add input fields for users to enter deposit amounts and withdrawal amounts.
- Implement additional validation and error handling.
- Display more detailed information about the user's savings history.
- Improve the user interface and styling.

### Deployment

To deploy the Savings Contract, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Solidity contract using a Solidity compiler, such as Solidity's `solc` or Remix.

2. Deploy the compiled contract to the OKExChain testnet or mainnet of your choice using a tool like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

3. Obtain the contract address after deployment and update the React code with the correct contract address.

4. Update the contract ABI if any changes have been made to the contract's functions or structure.

5. Test the deployment and integration thoroughly before handling real funds.

### Security Considerations

When working with smart contracts and handling user funds, it's essential to prioritize security. Here are some security considerations to keep in mind:

- Thoroughly test the contract for vulnerabilities and perform a security audit if possible.
- Consider using a secure development framework like OpenZeppelin to ensure best practices.
- Implement proper input validation and error handling to prevent unexpected behavior.
- Be cautious when handling user funds and ensure proper access controls are in place.
- Regularly update dependencies and keep up with the latest security patches and best practices.

### Conclusion

The Savings Contract offers a straightforward solution for users to save OKT and earn Ine tokens with compound interest. By integrating the contract with a React frontend, users can easily interact with the contract and manage their savings. Remember to prioritize security and conduct thorough testing before deploying the contract in a production environment.
